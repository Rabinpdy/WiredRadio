# WiredRadio
some of the code from www.wiredradio.co.uk, Goldsmiths universityâ€™s student run online radio station. Built using HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL. This also involved configuring the server on which the site is hosted. 

NOTE:
Recently podcasted shows section and resident djs and individual dj pages are not live yet due issues with backend programs not compiling on Mac, with university and work not giving me enough time to fix this so far.
